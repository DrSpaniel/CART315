tinyGame!!| jan 23, 2025

I made a prototype game.

It was about breaking the matrix, also pretty short.

Seeing playtesting was really fun, watching people play and fid out that you could break the wall. 

I was told that my game is reminiscent of severance! And the stanley parable!!! Super flattering lol

Bedbugs! I couldnt make it to class. Really sucks.

No more bedbugs!

I'm in a predicament however. As i was not in the last class, i am kind of behind on the current assignment:

Exploration Prototype 2 - Using the material that we looked at this week (physics, object tags, scoring, sound, etc) experiment with a game prototype and then document the exploration. What is your idea? What are you trying to test? What did you learn? Was it successful? Where might you go next if you wanted to keep exploring this idea? If you are stuck, think about how you could change some of these things to make an experimental version of the Pawng game we created. For instance, what happens if some of the object attributes change over time? Or every time the ball bounces?

So… to catch up i will keep things simple and stripped down. I'm going to modify the game that we made in the 30th, which is catching balls and then they disappear into that they bounce with gravity and then make a “boing!” sound that i will generate with SFXR. currently i'm watching this:

[How To Add Sound Effects the RIGHT Way | Unity Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OT43pvUyfY)

Brackeys is awesome!!!!! Anyway i got it that when the balls spawn, they make a (annoying) noise! Now i'm gonna make it that it makes another sound when it hits the block.

Okay update……. I am very very very dumb. Very. 

I have been trying to make it that the circle makes a disappear sound, and i was trying again and again and again even though when i click on the script the sound is assigned…….

And then i just realized like right now that the script IN the gameobject needs a sound assigned 

AAHHHHHHH my god i spent 2 hours on that. Lesson well learned though!!!!! The thing makes a sound!!!! Holy shit!!!!


also.... i wannamake an agario clone.
