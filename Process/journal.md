#tinyGame!!| jan 23, 2025

I made a prototype game.

It was about breaking the matrix, also pretty short.

Seeing playtesting was really fun, watching people play and fid out that you could break the wall. 

I was told that my game is reminiscent of severance! And the stanley parable!!! Super flattering lol
